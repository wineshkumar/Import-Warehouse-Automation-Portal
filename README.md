# Import Warehouse Customer Automation & e-Document Exchange Portal

## Overview

This project introduces a parallel digital automation layer integrated
with the existing Cargo Management System (1Cargo) to reduce physical
customer interaction and enable secure electronic document exchange.

The system provides customers, customs agents, and internal staff with
real-time shipment visibility, digital documentation, automated
workflows, and intelligent delivery scheduling.
